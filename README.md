<h2>Elevator pitch:</h2>
<p>An ear training application for children 1-3 years old to develop perfect pitch.</p>

<h2>Where the idea came from:</h2>
<p>In 1995-1996 while enrolled in IB music (International Bachaloreate program) I wrote an essay asserting that the reason a higher percentage of the population doesn't have perfect pitch is that we don't educate children at an early enough age and we don't provide educators with the necessary tools to teach perfect pitch. This assertion went against popular belief that perfect pitch is something that is genetic - it is something that children are born with and not something that can be taught. In my essay I drew parallels to language. It is a well known fact that beyond a certain age humans are not able to learn new languages with the same level of proficiency that they would have if they had learned it as a child. I also drew parallels using the word n√£o (Portuguese word for no). Children that learn the nuances of how to pronounce the word before they are 12 are able to replicate this unique sound. Beyond that point, it is very difficult (arguably impossible) to teach a human (particularly one that doesn't already speak another romantic language) to properly pronounce the word. Given the lack of scientific evidence I received a bad grade for my essay. Dr. Spano (my teacher at the time) was a firm believer that perfect pitch is in fact something that is genetic and can't be taught.<br>

I still believe that by systematically introducing notes while maximizing the benefits of spacial memory we can in fact teach the vast majority of children in the world to have perfect pitch. I concede that a small percentage of the population will never be able to have perfect pitch. This should go without saying given that a certain percentage of the population is and will sadly continue to be deaf.<br>

This project aims to put my theory to rest (whether I'm right or wrong). I really hope to prove Dr. Spano wrong! :-)</p>

<h2>MVP:</h2>
<p>An application that will play individual notes and present users with color coded (and notated) options. The game will start presenting only two notes (with only two possible squares). Once the user reaches a certain level of proficiency (get five notes correct consecutively) a third note will be introduced. This pattern will continue until the entire chromatic scale is presented.</p>

<h2>Color association:</h2>
<p>In order to maximize the benefits of spacial memory, colors will be used and remain constant for each note as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A = blue</li>
  <li>Bb = red</li>
  <li>B = </li>
  <li>C = </li>
  <li>Db = </li>
  <li>D = </li>
  <li>Eb = </li>
  <li>E =</li>
  <li>F = </li>
  <li>F# = </li>
  <li>G = </li>
  <li>Ab =</li>
</ul>

<p>A/B testing could be done where instead of using colored squares, cartoon characters would be used to identify notes.</p>
