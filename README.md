<h2>Elevator pitch:</h2>
<p>An ear training application for children 1-3 years old to develop perfect pitch.</p>

<h2>MVP:</h2>
<p>An application that will play individual notes and present users with color coded (and notated) options. The game will start presenting only two notes (with only two possible circles). Once the user reaches a certain level of proficiency (get five notes correct consecutively) a third note will be introduced. This pattern will continue until the entire chromatic scale is presented.</p>

<h2>Technology: </h2>
<p>This project was built in JavaScript, Express and uses a Postgres database.</p>
